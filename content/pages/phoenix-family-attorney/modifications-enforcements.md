    text: "Even after a divorce, child custody, or parenting time dispute is finalized, there may come a time when you need additional legal support to address enforcement issues or to modify the original order. If you need assistance with enforcement or you feel that a change of circumstances warrants a modification in the original order, it is important to consult with a family law attorney who can protect your rights. At Blumberg & Associates, our\_**Phoenix modifications and enforcements attorneys**\_have extensive experience in representing clients seeking a modification. We can also represent clients who want to challenge or defend against a modification to an original order.\n\nYour rights and interests are at stake. When you need assistance with the enforcement of an order or are seeking to obtain or defend against a modification, we can protect your rights.\n\nYou may be seeking a modification to an original child custody order. The court is willing to grant a modification when there is a change in circumstances that makes the original order unfeasible or impractical. For more information about modifications, please contact us for a consultation.\n\n## ENFORCEMENT OF BROKEN AGREEMENTS OR ORDERS\n\nAfter an original order is finalized, some parties are faced with the additional burden of seeing that the order is enforced.
