    text: "Spousal maintenance (also known as “alimony” or “spousal support”) is a set amount paid from one spouse to another to maintain a standard of living after divorce. Spousal maintenance will be based on factors including ability to pay, income of both parties, and duration of marriage.\n\nOur\_**Phoenix spousal maintenance attorneys**\_know how to protect your rights and assets after a divorce. Whether you are seeking to collect spousal maintenance or defend against unmanageable obligations, we can inform you of your rights and take a proactive approach to successfully resolve your case. While we are skilled negotiators, we are also skilled litigators and can take your case to trial if necessary.\n\n## SPOUSAL MAINTENANCE CALCULATION\n\nThe amount and duration of Spousal Maintenance is usually calculated based on a number of factors, including:\n\n*   The standard of living established during the marriage;\n\n*   The duration of the marriage;\n\n*   The age, employment history, earning ability, and physical and emotional condition of the individual seeking support;\n\n*   The ability of the individual who would be paying support to meet his or her needs while paying the other party spousal maintenance;\n\n*   The comparative financial resources of the parties, including their comparative earning abilities in the labor market;\n\n*   If the individual requesting support contributed to the earning ability of the other party;\n\n*   The extent to which the individual seeking maintenance has reduced their income or career opportunities for the benefit of the other individual;\n\n*   The ability of the both parties after the dissolution to contribute to the future educational costs of their mutual children;\n\n*   The financial recourses of the individual requesting support to determine his or her ability to provide for his or her needs independently;\n\n*   The time necessary to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the party seeking maintenance to find appropriate employment and whether such education or training is readily available;\n\n*   Excessive or abnormal expenditures, destruction, concealment or fraudulent disposition of community, joint tenancy and other property held in common;\n\n*   The cost for the spouse who is seeking maintenance to obtain health insurance and the reduction in the cost of health insurance for the spouse from whom maintenance is sought;\n\n*   All actual damages and judgments from conduct that results in criminal conviction of either spouse in which the other spouse or child was the victim.\n\n## CONTACT EXPERIENCED PHOENIX FAMILY LAW ATTORNEYS\n\nOur lawyers will take every step necessary to protect your rights. Whether in negotiations and settlement or court, we know how to secure your best interests.\n\nContact Blumberg & Associates, at\_[602-277-6180](tel:+16022776180)\_for a consultation with an experienced Phoenix, family law attorney.\n"
