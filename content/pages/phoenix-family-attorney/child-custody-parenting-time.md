    text: "Issues involving children can be the most difficult family law cases. Whether there is a dispute arising at the time of divorce or you are facing a custody case related to paternity or a modification or enforcement of an original order, you should work with an experienced family law attorney that can protect your rights. At Blumberg & Associates, we focus our attention on providing legal solutions in the best interests of our clients and their children. Cases involving children can be painful, complex and difficult for all parties. To ensure that your rights are secured and your child’s best interests are protected, please contact a\_**Phoenix child custody and parenting time attorney**\_for a consultation or case evaluation.\n\n## CHILD CUSTODY GUIDELINES\n\nThere are basic guidelines for custody, but it is important that you work with a family attorney that can clearly articulate your rights as well as your child’s best interests. The court wants to know who is in the best position to care for the child, who has the most intimate and ongoing relationship with the child, and who has been the caretaker in the past. There are a number of other considerations that may become relevant. We work often with clients in mediation and other alternative dispute settings, but are not afraid to take any case to trial on your behalf.\n\nAfter a divorce, parents may be forced to share custody of their children, creating parenting schedules that may be difficult to manage, and forcing their children to adapt to two households. A custody dispute and parenting time schedule can be very difficult for all parties involved, especially the children. We will take the time to understand your needs and come up with a parenting plan according to the needs of the child.\_ While we are focused on protecting your rights, we will work within the court’s standard that tailors the visitation schedule to the best interest of the child.\n\n## CONTACT A PHOENIX CHILD CUSTODY AND PARENTING TIME ATTORNEY\n\nAt Blumberg & Associates, we are focused on providing our clients with strategic advocacy and support to protect their rights and interests in parenting time cases.\_A parenting time schedule dispute can disrupt your life and your relationship with your children. Let us protect what is important to you.\_Call our office today for a consultation with our attorneys.\n"
