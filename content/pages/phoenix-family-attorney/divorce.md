      Filing for divorce in Arizona can seriously impact your life. Your
      financial security, children, and stability are at stake. Beyond the legal
      consequences, you may face emotional fallout that can last long after a
      divorce is finalized. It is believed by many experts that spouses who are
      involved in a divorce go through the same five stages of grief as someone
      who has had a death in the family.


      ## THE FIVE STAGES OF GRIEF ARE:


      *   **First Stage:** Denial and Isolation;


      *   **Second Stage:** Anger;


      *   **Third Stage:** Bargaining;


      *   **Fourth Stage:**  Depression; and


      *   **Fifth Stage:** Acceptance.


      If true, this process would have a direct effect on the ability of the
      spouses to communicate with each other. At Blumberg & Associates, we work
      to give you the advocacy and support you need to provide solutions into
      the future.


      Contact us for a consultation with an experienced family lawyer. Whether
      you are considering a divorce, or have recently been served dissolution
      papers, it is always important to understand your rights and obligations
      through the process. Our attorneys will explain all your options and
      alternatives, and help you protect your rights and interests during the
      marriage dissolution proceedings.

      *   Divorce


      *   Property Division


      *   Paternity

      ## THIS IS YOUR CASE. WE FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS TO YOU.

      a deep impact on your life. We will take a proactive approach to restore
      the security in your life and protect your rights into the future. At your
