I hired Bruce in 2008 to represent my son in a sex crime case and again in 2016 to help my son with a probation violation hearing. Bruce was more than a lawyer in that he became a friend. He is straight forward and no-nonsense. One of his greatest assets is that he is well connected and well respected among his peers and that removes a lot of hurdles when it comes to getting the best deal possible for his client. I highly recommend Bruce as an attorney you can trust and rely on.
