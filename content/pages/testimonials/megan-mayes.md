Mr. Blumberg really helped me out when I was in a bind last year. He is kind, thorough, professional and yet a pit bull in the courtroom when needed. He appeared and was on time at every court date, even at the initial appearances, which I believe is extremely important. He along with his assistant Susan were always available throughout the duration of the case when I had questions or concerns. Bruce is well known and extremely respected within the court system which is also why I feel I chose the right person to help me. My family and I are grateful for his representation!
