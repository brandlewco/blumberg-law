    text: "Bruce Blumberg is the founder and principal attorney at Blumberg & Associates, a Phoenix law firm serving clients throughout Phoenix and statewide in the areas of criminal defense and family law. A leading criminal defense lawyer in the state, Bruce is one of only a handful of attorneys to be certified as a specialist in criminal law by the State Bar of Arizona.\n\nAs a criminal defense lawyer in Phoenix, Bruce handles the full range of Arizona criminal law matters, from juvenile offenses and probation violations to the most serious felonies. Bruce has successfully handled a number of murder and violent crime trials and has served as Appointed Counsel in many Maricopa County death penalty cases. A hardworking, dedicated and passionate attorney, Bruce excels in serious felony cases where the stakes are high. Having handled thousands of cases over more than 40 years in practice, he knows how the police investigate, how the prosecutors prepare, and how judges and juries decide the issues before them. Bruce is particularly well-known for his exceptional closing arguments, which are some of the last words a jury hears before going into deliberations to decide the fate of the accused.\n\nBruce is a 1976 graduate of Michigan State University, where he majored in Pre-Law. He next earned his law degree from the Thomas M. Cooley Law School at Western Michigan University and immediately began his legal career. Bruce practiced law in Michigan during the day while earning a Master of Laws in Taxation (LL.M.) from Wayne State University in Detroit at night.\n\nBruce was admitted to practice in Michigan and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in 1979. He soon relocated to Arizona and was admitted to practice in all Arizona state courts and the U.S. District Court of Arizona in 1986. He has been an Arizona Board-Certified Specialist in Criminal Law since 1999.\n\nBruce is a member of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the National Trial Lawyers Association. He can be reached by calling Blumberg & Associates in Phoenix at\_[602-277-6180](tel:+16022776180).\n"
