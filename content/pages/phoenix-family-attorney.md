      ## PASSIONATE ADVOCACY IN HIGH-CONFLICT DIVORCE AND CUSTODY LITIGATION


      Although primarily a criminal defense law firm, Blumberg & Associates
      offers able and effective assistance in a range of Arizona family law
      matters. Just as in a criminal case, family law clients going through a[
      divorce](https://azblumberglaw.com/phoenix-family-attorney/divorce/) or[
      child
      custody](https://azblumberglaw.com/phoenix-family-attorney/child-custody-parenting-time/)
      battle have a lot at stake, and they don’t want to take chances with their
      future or their children’s future. Bruce Blumberg uses his superior trial
      skills and experience to represent clients through high-conflict family
      law litigation. Call our **Phoenix family attorney** if you anticipate
      trouble in an Arizona divorce or child custody dispute and want to make
      sure you have strong and zealous representation from an experienced
      litigator dedicated to looking out for you and protecting your rights.


      ## PROTECT YOUR RIGHTS IN AN ARIZONA DIVORCE


      Getting a divorce is more than just having the court legally dissolve a
      marriage. The judge also makes binding court orders in vital areas such as
      the distribution of community property,[ spousal
      maintenance](https://azblumberglaw.com/phoenix-family-attorney/spousal-maintenance/),
      and child custody. These decisions are final and can affect you and your
      children for years to come.


      When a couple cannot agree on how to resolve the issues in a contested
      divorce, it’s up to the judge to decide vital matters such as the division
      of marital property and the payment of spousal support, or child child
      support. This process involves a period of litigation, including pre-trial
      discovery, the gathering and organizing of evidence, and presenting that
      evidence and testimony to a judge during a hearing. The judge weighs the
      evidence as well as the strength of any legal arguments made by the
      attorneys. In reaching their decisions, family court judges are required
      by Arizona law to consider a long list of statutory factors and other
      relevant evidence. Count on Blumberg & Associates to analyze all
      appropriate factors and deliver a persuasive case with cogent legal
      arguments and compelling presentations that convincingly demonstrate the
      proper ruling on these critical matters.


      ## PROTECT YOUR FAMILY IN A PHOENIX CHILD CUSTODY BATTLE


      Child custody involves both physical custody and legal custody, and when
      the parents can’t agree, it’s up to the judge to decide how to allocate
      legal decision-making authority as well as parenting time. These rights
      and responsibilities can be shared equally between the parents, or one
      parent can be given primary custody. The overarching concern of the court
      is to make decisions in the best interests of the child. In reaching its
      conclusions, the judge must consider a number of factors, including the
      relationship between parent and child, which parent is more likely to
      allow contact between the children and the other parent, and any history
      or evidence of domestic violence or abuse by either parent. We’ll build a
      strong case supported by solid evidence and persuasive legal arguments to
      make sure you and your children are looked after properly in any custody
      dispute, and avoid legal separation.


      Blumberg & Associates also handles post-judgment matters in Maricopa
      County family court, including motions to modify or terminate spousal
      maintenance or change the custody or parenting plan. We represent parents
      seeking or opposing a parental relocation, as well as parties seeking or
      challenging enforcement of domestic relations court orders for child
      custody or spousal support.
