    text: "Bank fraud involves the use of a banking institution in connection with conduct of a fraudulent enterprise or making a material omission or misrepresentation in application for a bank loan. Bank employees, such as loan officers, as well as bank customers can be charged with fraud. The typical charge is that, in exchange for money, a bank employee approves a loan that should not have been approved.\n\nIf you are under investigation for or have been charged with bank fraud in Arizona, contact the\_**Phoenix bank fraud attorneys**\_at Blumberg & Associates for a free initial consultation.\n\nThe charges in bank fraud cases can vary widely, depending on whether you are charged in Arizona state court or in federal court. Arizona prosecutors will typically charge you with fraud, which is obtaining a benefit by means of a material misrepresentation or omission. Federal laws are very broad and you may face multiple counts, including mail or wire fraud and conspiracy.\n\nTo convict you of bank or loan fraud, the prosecutors must prove that you intended to commit a crime. Many people sign documents such as loan applications without reading them. In some case, people may believe their assets are worth more than the government thinks they are worth. This may be an honest mistake on your part, but the government may see it as fraud.\n\n## FREE ATTORNEY CONSULTATION\n\nIf you find out you are under investigation for bank, loan or check fraud, please contact a defense attorney as soon as possible. The sooner you contact us, the more we can do to protect your rights. Our defense lawyers negotiate with state and federal authorities throughout Arizona, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Frequently, we persuade prosecutors to file reduced charges or even not to charge our clients.\n"
