      Blumberg & Associates is committed to helping people throughout Arizona
      who have been arrested or charged with domestic violence offense. Our
      Phoenix domestic violence attorneys routinely help clients throughout the
      state of Arizona, including people in Maricopa County, Yavapai County,
      Coconino County, Pinal County, and the cities of Phoenix, Mesa, Glendale,
      Tempe, Peoria, Scottsdale, Prescott, Tucson, and Flagstaff.


      ## EXPERIENCED ARIZONA DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWYERS


      Our Phoenix, Az domestic violence attorneys routinely handle cases related
      to violent crimes, assault, battery, false imprisonment, kidnapping, sex
      crimes/sex offenses, stalking, and domestic abuse. Our domestic violence
      attorneys realize that false domestic violence charges are not uncommon in
      cases involving divorce and child custody issues. Our lawyers have
      successfully handled numerous cases where our clients were accused of
      violating orders of protection.


      If you are charged with domestic violence, never try to resolve the
      problem on your own. Any contact with the victim could result in
      additional charges. If you are charged with domestic violence, do not talk
      to anyone except an experienced Arizona domestic violence attorney.


      ## ARIZONA DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES


      There is a general misconception that domestic violence is an act against
      a spouse. However, domestic violence laws apply to spouses, partners,
      former partners, people who are dating, and the elderly. In Arizona, a
      domestic violence charge is serious.


      If you have been charged with any domestic violence offenses in Arizona,
      you must take it seriously. Arizona domestic violence laws have been under
      intense scrutiny by the Arizona legislature. Over the past few years, law
      enforcement has developed new policies, the court system has implemented
      far-reaching changes, and prosecuting attorneys have taken an active role
      in zealously enforcing both new and existing laws. You can now be charged
      with domestic violence even if the victim refuses to assist in
      prosecution.


      The consequence of a domestic violence conviction can be severe. If you
      are convicted of a misdemeanor or a felony, you could lose the right to
      own firearms, the right to vote, and possibly your freedom.


      ## CONTACT OUR ARIZONA DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ATTORNEYS


      If you have been charged with domestic violence, please contact Blumberg &
      Associates. When your future is on the line, you need an Arizona domestic
      violence law firm where skill and experience are more than just a slogan.
