      Phoenix Drug Crimes Attorney
    text: "Blumberg & Associates is committed to helping people throughout Arizona who have been arrested or charged with domestic violence offense. Our\_**Phoenix domestic violence attorneys**\_routinely help clients throughout the state of Arizona, including people in Maricopa County, Yavapai County, Coconino County, Pinal County, and the cities of Phoenix, Mesa, Glendale, Tempe, Peoria, Scottsdale, Prescott, Tucson, and Flagstaff.\n\n## EXPERIENCED ARIZONA DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWYERS\n\nOur Arizona domestic violence attorneys routinely handle cases related to violent crimes, assault, battery, false imprisonment, kidnapping, sex crimes/sex offenses, and stalking. Our domestic violence attorneys realize that false domestic violence charges are not uncommon in cases involving divorce and child custody issues. Our lawyers have successfully handled numerous cases where our clients were accused of violating orders of protection.\n\nIf you are charged with domestic violence, never try to resolve the problem on your own. Any contact with the victim could result in additional charges. If you are charged with domestic violence, do not talk to anyone except an experienced Arizona domestic violence attorney.\n\n## ARIZONA DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES\n\nThere is a general misconception that domestic violence is an act against a spouse. However, domestic violence laws apply to spouses, partners, former partners, people who are dating, and the elderly. In Arizona, domestic violence charges are serious.\n\nIf you have been charged with a domestic violence offense in Arizona, you must take it seriously. Arizona domestic violence laws have been under intense scrutiny by the Arizona legislature. Over the past few years, law enforcement has developed new policies, the court system has implemented far-reaching changes, and prosecuting attorneys have taken an active role in zealously enforcing both new and existing laws. You can now be charged with domestic violence even if the victim refuses to prosecute.\n\nThe consequence of a domestic violence conviction can be severe. If you are convicted of a misdemeanor or a felony, you could lose the right to own firearms, the right to vote, and possibly your freedom.\n\n## CONTACT OUR ARIZONA DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ATTORNEYS\n\nIf you have been charged with domestic violence, please contact Blumberg & Associates. When your future is on the line, you need an Arizona domestic violence law firm where skill and experience are more than just a slogan.\n"
