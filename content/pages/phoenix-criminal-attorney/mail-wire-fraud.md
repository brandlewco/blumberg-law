    text: "Like money laundering, wire fraud and mail fraud are catch-all criminal charges that usually accompany other charges such as drug trafficking or theft. The basic allegation is that you used the U.S. mail, a telephone, a facsimile or another electronic transmission device in the commission of a crime. The charges need to be taken very seriously.\n\nIf you are under investigation for or have been charged with mail or wire fraud in Arizona, contact the\_**Phoenix mail and wire fraud attorneys**\_at Blumberg & Associates for a free initial consultation to discuss your case.\n\nThis charge is often applied to drug dealers who send controlled substances such as cocaine and [marijuana](https://azblumberglaw.com/phoenix-criminal-attorney/marijuana/) through the mail. Federal postal inspectors are sworn officers who can obtain a search warrant to open a suspicious package, inspect the contents, repackage the contents and deliver the package. Even people who are marginally involved in the criminal activity can be charged with wire or mail fraud if they pick up packages on behalf of another person.\n\nTelemarketers and investors can be charged with wire or mail fraud if their marketing practices are alleged to be fraudulent. Mail and wire fraud can refer to any activity that illegally attempts to gain money using the mail, telephone or wire transmission.\n\n## FREE ATTORNEY CONSULTATION\n\nYou may find out you are under investigation for wire or mail fraud long before you are charged. The sooner you contact\_our\_Phoenix mail and wire fraud attorneys at Blumberg & Associates, the more we can do to protect your rights. Our defense lawyers frequently negotiate with the state and federal authorities throughout Arizona, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Postal Service. In many cases, we have successfully persuaded prosecutors not to charge our clients or to file reduced charges.\n"
