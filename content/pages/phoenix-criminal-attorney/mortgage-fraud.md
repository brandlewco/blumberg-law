    text: "The fallout of the current home mortgage crisis, combined with declining real estate values, has resulted in many people facing criminal charges for transactions that they did not even know were illegal. If you are under investigation for or have been charged with mortgage fraud in Arizona, call the\_**Phoenix mortgage fraud attorneys**\_at Blumberg & Associates for a free initial consultation to discuss your case.\n\nMortgage fraud usually involves inflating the value of real estate used as collateral in a loan or misrepresenting your net income in order to obtain a loan. Mortgage companies are often complicit in fraud because they urge people to apply for loans even when they do not qualify. However, state and federal prosecutors typically do not charge institutions with mortgage fraud. Prosecutors are going after individual loan officers, real estate brokers, builders, contractors and borrowers.\n\nMany people involved in what they believe are legitimate transactions can find themselves facing mortgage fraud charges. Since the penalties are linked to the amount of fraud, the consequences for the person charged can be disastrous. Mortgage fraud usually involves loans of hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. As a result, anyone convicted of mortgage fraud can find himself or herself facing a lengthy prison sentence.\n\n## FREE ATTORNEY CONSULTATION\n\nIf you find out you are under investigation for mortgage or real estate fraud, please contact a Phoenix mortgage fraud attorney at Blumberg & Associates as soon as possible. Our attorneys negotiate with state and federal authorities throughout Arizona, including the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In many cases, we have successfully persuaded prosecutors not to charge our clients or to file reduced charges.\n"
