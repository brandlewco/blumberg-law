      Blumberg & Associates is an experienced Arizona criminal defense law firm.
      Our **Phoenix sexual assault attorneys** have significant experience
      representing people charged with rape in the state of Arizona. We
      represent clients from Maricopa County, Yavapai County, Coconino County,
      and Pinal County, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Mesa, Peoria, Tempe,
      Scottsdale, Prescott, Tucson, and Flagstaff.


      ## EXPERIENCED SEXUAL ASSAULT REPRESENTATION


      Sexual assault cases are difficult for both the defense and the
      prosecution. Often these cases come down to a “he said, she said”
      situation where the credibility of the two parties is the final
      determinant. A common misperception in rape cases is that the sexual
      history of a victim is admissible in evidence. Unless it is somehow
      relevant to the case, it is not. An example of relevant sexual history
      would be the victim’s sexual history involving the defendant. Whereas the
      victim’s sexual relationships with other people would not ordinarily be
      relevant.


      Our Arizona sexual assault lawyers have significant experience handling
      and winning cases involving claims of non-consensual sex. We have handled
      cases related to rape, date rape, Rohypnol or GHB, sexual conduct with a
      minor (under 18 but over 14 years of age), and cases where claims of
      intoxication or drugs made a person mentally or physically incapable of
      consenting to sex. Sentences for individuals convicted of sexual assault
      range from probation to prison terms that can exceed fourteen years.


      In Arizona, statutory rape is defined as sexual conduct with a minor under
      age 18. Statuory rape conviction carries severe penalties under criminal
      law, particularly for cases involving minors under the age 15 years old.


      ## SEXUAL ASSAULT SENTENCING


      Sex crimes that do not involve children can be charged as either
      misdemeanor or felony offenses depending on the charge. However, Arizona’s
      mandatory sentencing laws require that anyone convicted of a felony sexual
      assault receive a five to fourteen year prison sentence for a first
      offense. Whether you are convicted of a sex crime requiring prison or
      allowing for probation, the state of Arizona requires lifetime probation
      and registration as a sex offender along with full sex offender terms,
      including a sex offender treatment program.
