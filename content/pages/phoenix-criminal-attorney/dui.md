Our experienced Arizona DUI attorney can explain your rights and help you avoid the harshest penalties associated with a drunk driving conviction.\n\nAt Blumberg & Associates, our primary goal in every DUI case we handle is to protect our clients’ rights to own and operate a motor vehicle and to keep them out of jail. Our\_**Phoenix DUI attorneys**\_have successfully handled hundreds of drunk driving cases. Our first course of action in most of our DUI cases is to challenge the stop. Even if you are drunk you have a Fourth Amendment right that prevents unreasonable search and seizure. Therefore the arresting officer must have cause to stop your vehicle.\n\nOur DUI attorneys also work to ensure your rights are protected with respect to your driving privileges in the state of Arizona.\n\n## CONSEQUENCES OF AN ARIZONA DRUNK DRIVING CONVICTION\n\nIn recent years, fines and jail time have increased for people convicted of DUI. Even being charged with a driving under the influence can result in a suspension or restriction of your driving privilege. If you are arrested and have a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .08 or more, your driver’s license must be surrendered immediately. If you refuse to take a BAC test, your license will be suspended for twelve months. All of this occurs prior to a drunk driving conviction.\n\nIf you are convicted of an Arizona DUI and your blood alcohol concentration is .08 to .149 the consequences include:\n\n### First Offense\n\n*   Up to six months in jail\n\n*   A fine up to $2,500\n\n*   Court ordered substance abuse counseling\n\n*   Community Service\n\n*   10 days in jail (9 are eligible to be suspended)\n\n### Second Offense\n\n*   Up to six months in jail\n\n*   Drivers license Revocation\n\n*   A fine up to $2,500\n\n*   Court ordered substance abuse counseling\n\n*   Community Service\n\n*   Ignition Interlock Device\n\nIf you are convicted of a DUI in Arizona and your blood alcohol concentration is above .15, know as an Extreme DUI, the consequences include:\n\n### First Offense\n\n*   Up to six months in jail\n\n*   Minimum 30 days license suspension\n\n*   A fine up to $2,500\n\n*   A $250 assessment to the Driving Under the Influence Abatement Fund\n\n*   Court ordered substance abuse counseling\n\n*   Community Service\n\n*   Ignition Interlock Device\n\n### Second Offense\n\n*   Up to six months in jail\n\n*   Revocation of license\n\n*   A fine up to $2,500\n\n*   $250 assessment to the Driving Under the Influence Abatement Fund\n\n*   Court ordered substance abuse counseling\n\n*   Community Service\n\n*   Ignition Interlock Device\n\n## CONTACT OUR PHOENIX DUI DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nOur Phoenix DUI defense attorneys regularly represent clients from throughout Maricopa County including the cities of Phoenix, Tempe, and Scottsdale who are charged with driving under the influence, extreme DUI, and aggravated driving under the influence.
