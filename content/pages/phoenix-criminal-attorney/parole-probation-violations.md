Our office is located in the Luhrs Tower, just steps away from the Superior Court, the County Attorney’s Office, and the Maricopa County Jail. Our location allows us to quickly and efficiently handle legal issues dealing with Parole and Probation Violations.\n\n## ARIZONA PROBATION VIOLATION LAWYER\n\nProbation is granted as an alternative to prison for certain crime, such as some first time drug offenses, domestic violence, and some juvenile offenses. Whenever plausible, our attorneys strive to gain probation for our clients. However, if you are granted probation and are charged with another crime, you could not only face prison time for the new crime, but also for the crime for which you were granted probation.\n\nAt Blumberg & Associates, our criminal defense attorneys know that just because you were once convicted of a crime does not mean that you committed another crime. Our probation violation attorneys routinely work with clients who are in danger of having their probation revoked and sent to prison.\n\n## CONTACT OUR PHOENIX PAROLE & PROBATION VIOLATION ATTORNEYS\n\nIf you are facing criminal charges that violate either your parole or probation, contact Blumberg & Associates immediately. We represent clients throughout Arizona including Maricopa County, Yavapai County, Coconino County, Pinal County, and the cities of Phoenix, Mesa, Glendale, Tempe, Peoria, Scottsdale, Prescott, Tucson, and Flagstaff. When your freedom is on the line, you need an Arizona parole or probation violations law firm where skill and experience are more than just a slogan.\n"
