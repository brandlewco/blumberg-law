    text: "Embezzlement charges can range from misusing corporate credit cards and forging checks to committing employee theft and making fraudulent payments to vendors. If you are under investigation for or have been charged with embezzlement in Arizona, contact the\_**Phoenix embezzlement attorneys**\_at Blumberg & Associates for a free initial consultation to discuss your case.\n\nEmbezzlement charges often involve accounting practices. Our firm defended a woman who was charged with four counts of forging checks for a total of $40,000 in cash over two or three years. According to our client, she was authorized by her boss to write the checks and gave him the cash. Our defense attorneys attacked the state’s charges by presenting our client as an honest employee who was engaging in work she was thought was legitimate and by questioning the credibility of her boss, who had a track record for untruthfulness. Our client was found not guilty of all charges except one “lesser-included” count of theft, which we are currently appealing. In a similar case, our firm was able to get the charges against another bookkeeper dismissed.\n\nEmbezzlement charges can allege activities over a long period of time, resulting in a large amount of money being involved. Since the penalties in an embezzlement case are linked to the amount of money taken, the potential penalties can be disastrous. In Maricopa County, you face at least one year flat in county jail. For repetitive crimes and for two or more two charges on the same occasion, the Arizona legislature has instituted mandatory sentencing with mandatory prison time.\n\n## FREE ATTORNEY CONSULTATION\n\nYou may find out you are under investigation for employee theft or embezzlement long before you are charged. The sooner you contact a Phoenix defense attorney Blumberg & Associates, the more we can do to protect your rights and your future.\n"
