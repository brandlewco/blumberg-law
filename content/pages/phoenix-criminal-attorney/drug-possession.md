      Conviction on a charge of drug possession can result in jail time, heavy
      fines, and a life-long criminal record. Additionally, since most employers
      have a zero-tolerance drug policy, you could lose your job. Your insurance
      rates will likely increase, you may not be eligible for a student loan,
      and you will have to answer “yes” to questions on job applications that
      ask if you’ve ever been convicted for a crime.


      However, depending on the amount of drugs involved and your criminal
      history, you may be eligible to participate in a diversion program that
      drops the charge against you and removes it from your record. At Blumberg
      & Associates, our **Phoenix drug possession attorneys** have represented
      thousands of clients over the years in drug possession cases. In many
      instances, we are able to work with prosecutors to have the charges or
      sentence against our client reduced.


      If you’ve been arrested for drug possession, contact criminal defense
      attorneys at Blumberg & Associates today to schedule an appointment and
      discuss your case. We will evaluate the circumstances surrounding your
      arrest and explain the options available to you.


      ## THRESHOLDS AND DRUG POSSESSION


      Sentencing is affected by the amount of drugs involved in a drug-related
      crime. When the amount of drugs exceeds “threshold,” the likelihood of
      serving some time in jail increases. Under [Arizona criminal
      statute](/phoenix-criminal-attorney/state-drug-crimes/) A.R.S. §13-3401,
      thresholds for marijuana, cocaine, and heroin are as follows:


      *   Marijuana – 2 pounds


      *   Cocaine – 9 grams (powder); 750 milligrams (rock form)


      *   Heroin – 1 gram


      *   Methamphetamine – 9 grams


      In some cases involving drug amounts in excess of threshold, the judge
      still has discretion in sentencing. However, in cases involving possession
      of methamphetamine the sentence must be a minimum of 5 years, a
      presumptive of 10 and a maximum of 15 “flat” years in prison. This area
      must be examined closely that’s why it’s important to work with an
      attorney who understands how to tell your story and work with prosecutors
      to arrange a deal that reduces the charges or sentence against you. At
      Blumberg & Associates, we ask the court to consider job loss, illness, a
      history of abuse, psychological problems, and other factors that help
      explain why they turned to drugs.


      Our goal is to help people get a second chance, to get them the assistance
      they need so they can, hopefully regain control over their lives again.
      Sending someone to jail where they won’t get the treatment they need
      doesn’t help anyone.


      ## MARIJUANA POSSESSION UNDER THRESHOLD: FIRST-TIME OFFENDERS


      In cases of marijuana possession under threshold, adults who haven’t been
      convicted on a felony drug charge or for a violent offense are eligible to
      participate in a deferred prosecution program. If you are a first time
      offender, our attorneys ask that you be referred to a Treatment Assessment
      Screening Center (TASC) for counseling and help. If you successfully
      complete the program and stay clean, the TASC will recommend that the
      charges against you be dismissed and dropped from your record. You are
      required to pay for the TASC classes yourself. However, this is a small
      price to pay for having your record expunged and the charges against you
      dismissed.


      ## PRESCRIPTION DRUGS


      People struggling with physical pain or depression may find themselves
      addicted to prescription medications like Xanax, Ativan, Oxycontin, or
      Valium. However, possession of these drugs without a valid prescription
      can result in drug possession charges. Prescription drug charges are very
      serious and can lead to substantial jail time. Our attorneys take the time
      to explain our client’s situation, asking the court to allow our client to
      get the medical help and counseling needed, in exchange for a reduced
      sentence or charge. Bruce Blumberg is a top prescription drug crime lawyer
      in Phoenix.
