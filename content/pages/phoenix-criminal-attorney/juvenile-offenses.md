      Phoenix Juvenile Crime Attorney

    text: "The juvenile justice system is different than the adult justice system. Therefore it is important to have a criminal defense attorney that is familiar with how the juvenile justice system operates. At Blumberg & Associates, our\_**Phoenix juvenile crime attorneys**\_are committed to helping juveniles and their families resolve criminal charges in juvenile court.\n\n## THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM\n\nJuvenile courts operate differently than adult courts. Penalties generally aim at rehabilitation rather than punishment and cases are decided by judges, not juries. Additionally, records of juvenile offenses are, in most cases, sealed and do not follow people around the rest of their lives. However a disturbing trend has occurred in the last few years. More and more children charged with serious felonies are having their cases moved out of the juvenile justice system.\n\nOur juvenile defense attorneys work aggressively to keep juvenile defendants in the juvenile justice system, where the focus is on rehabilitation. We are not naïve. We understand that juveniles commit serious crimes such as sex offenses, drug crimes, and other violent crimes. However, we know that children who are put into the system designed for adult often remain in the system for much of their lives. Our attorneys believe that children deserve the opportunity to live productive lives.\n\n## DEFENDING JUVENILE CLIENTS\n\nWhile in many ways the juvenile justice system is different than that of adults, children still have the right to a quality defense. Our Arizona juvenile defense attorneys work diligently to provide children and families with the best legal advice available. In addition, we represent our juvenile clients at detention hearings, trials, and probation violation hearings. We strive to get our clients a minimum sentence, deferred prosecution or involved in alternative rehabilitation programs.\n\n## CONTACT OUR JUVENILE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nIf you are the parent of a juvenile charged with criminal offense anywhere in the state of Arizona, including Maricopa County, Yavapai County, Coconino County, Pinal County, and the cities of Phoenix, Mesa, Glendale, Tempe, Peoria, Scottsdale, Prescott, Tucson, and Flagstaff, please contact Blumberg & Associates. When your future is on the line, you need an Arizona juvenile criminal defense law firm where skill and experience are more than just a slogan.\n"
