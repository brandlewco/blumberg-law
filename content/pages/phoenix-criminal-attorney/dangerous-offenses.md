    text: "Blumberg & Associates is one of the leading criminal defense law firms in the state of Arizona. Our\_**Phoenix criminal defense attorneys**\_routinely handle a wide variety of violent crime cases involving aggravated assault, armed robbery, kidnapping, and bank robbery.\n\n## ARIZONA VIOLENT CRIME ATTORNEYS\n\nA wide array of crimes are considered violent crimes. Blumberg & Associates is an Arizona criminal defense law firm committed to defending people charged with violent crimes such as assault, sexual assault, armed robbery, kidnapping, car jacking, drive-by shooting, attempted murder, and burglary. These crimes are elevated to dangerous offenses when a [deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument](https://azblumberglaw.com/blog/what-is-considered-a-deadly-weapon-in-arizona/) is shown or used while the crime is being committed.\n\n## ARIZONA DANGEROUS OFFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nIn Arizona, most violent crimes can be elevated to a dangerous offense if the person charged showed a weapon or a dangerous instrument while the crime was being committed. The weapon does not have to be used, perhaps only exhibited or displayed in the assault, robbery, or kidnapping for dangerous offense charges to be filed.\n\nDangerous criminal offenses carry mandatory prison sentences of five to fifteen years for first time offenders. At Blumberg & Associates, we work to reduce charges in dangerous criminal offense cases so that our clients are probation eligible. While we negotiate to lessen the charges, our attorneys are skilled trial lawyers.\n\n## CONTACT OUR PHOENIX DANGEROUS OFFENSES ATTORNEYS\n\nOur Arizona dangerous offense attorneys regularly represent clients throughout the state of Arizona, including Maricopa County, Yavapai County, Coconino County, Pinal County, and the cities of Phoenix, Mesa, Glendale, Tempe, Peoria, Scottsdale, Prescott, Tucson, and Flagstaff. If you have been charged with a dangerous offense and need an attorney to represent you, please contact Blumberg & Associates. When your future is on the line, you need an Arizona law firm where skill and experience are more than just a slogan.\n"
