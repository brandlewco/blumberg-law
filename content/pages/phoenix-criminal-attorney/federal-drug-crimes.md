      Due to the so-called “war on drugs,” Congress has passed a number of “get
      tough” laws that have resulted in harsher penalties for federal drug
      crimes. In some instances, these laws created mandatory minimum sentences
      for certain kinds of drug crimes. Additionally, the federal criminal court
      system has its own unique set of procedures and rules that govern
      everything from discovery, grand jury testimony, conspiracy charges, the
      way investigations are conducted, and sentencing procedures. That’s why
      its essential to have an experienced Phoenix federal drug crimes attorney
      represent and advise you if you’ve been arrested on federal drug crime
      charges. At Blumberg & Associates, we’ve dedicated our practice
      exclusively to criminal defense work at both the state and federal level.


      Our attorneys are intimately familiar with the federal criminal justice
      system. We understand how to prepare and defend federal drug crimes cases
      and how to work with federal prosecutors during the sentencing phase of a
      trial. To schedule an appointment and learn how we can help you, contact
      the law office of Blumberg & Associates today.


      ## FEDERAL DRUG CRIMES PENALTIES


      At the federal level, sentencing for drug trafficking takes into account:
      the kind of drugs involved (see drug schedule in state sentencing cases),
      your criminal record, and whether any weapons, injuries, or deaths were
      involved. Prison sentences for large amounts of illegal drugs range
      anywhere from 5 to 40 years, depending on the kind of drugs smuggled and
      whether it is your first or second offense. If a death or injury is
      involved, prison sentences range from 20 years to life, even if it’s your
      first drug trafficking offense.


      In addition to prison, those convicted of drug trafficking could lose
      their property through criminal forfeiture and fined anywhere from
      $250,000 to as much as $20 million.


      ## BLAKEY, BOOKER AND MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCING


      In the past, certain drug crimes carried mandatory minimum sentences which
      left little, if any, discretion to judges when sentencing a defendant.
      However, after Blakey v. Washington and Booker v United States, judges are
      no longer required to impose mandatory minimums. Instead, mandatory
      minimums are now guidelines judges can take into consideration before
      imposing a sentence on a defendant.


      ## THE IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD DEFENSE LAWYER


      Due to Blakey and Booker, judges now have discretion when it comes to
      federal drug crimes sentencing. An experienced attorney who understands
      how prosecutors and judges think can prepare and present important
      information that may convince the court to reduce your sentence. Our
      attorneys work with psychologists, counselors, medical experts, and others
      in explaining how our client ended up making the decisions he or she did
      that led to their drug activity: evidence of job loss, illness, a history
      of being abused, lack of opportunity, or neglect may convince the court to
      reduce your sentence.


      We believe people deserve a second chance, and help in turning their lives
      around. While we cannot guarantee results, we can ensure you that we will
      use every opportunity and legal means available to reduce the sentence, or
      federal drug charges against you. To schedule a confidential consultation
      to discuss your case, contact federal drug crimes attorneys at Blumberg &
      Associates today.
