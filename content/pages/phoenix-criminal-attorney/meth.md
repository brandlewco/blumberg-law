    text: "## PROVIDING DRUG DEFENSE FOR CLIENTS THROUGHOUT ARIZONA\n\nBlumberg & Associates is a distinguished Arizona criminal defense law firm representing clients charged with [drug crimes](https://azblumberglaw.com/phoenix-criminal-attorney/state-drug-crimes/) related to methamphetamine. Our\_**Phoenix meth attorneys**\_routinely represent people charged with drug crimes from throughout Arizona including Maricopa County, Yavapai County, Coconino County, Pinal County, and the cities of Phoenix, Mesa, Peoria, Tempe, Prescott, Tucson, Flagstaff, and Scottsdale.\n\n## ARIZONA METHAMPHETAMINE ATTORNEYS\n\nAs the war on drugs has minimally limited the supply of some major narcotics such as cocaine and heroin, use of home grown drugs such as methamphetamine and [marijuana](https://azblumberglaw.com/phoenix-criminal-attorney/marijuana/) have increased. In the last few years, people arrested for methamphetamine use, possession, manufacture, and distribution have increased dramatically. As legislators have become aware of the increasing methamphetamine problem, and the ease with which methamphetamine ingredients can be accessed, they have increased the penalties associated with methamphetamine.\n\nThe possession of less than ten grams of methamphetamine is a class two felony and can result in a mandatory prison sentence of five to fifteen “flat,” or calendar years, with no early release. Whenever possible, our Arizona methamphetamine drug defense lawyers strive to negotiate plea agreements in meth cases. Most of our clients charged with use or possession are not sentenced to prison.\nFor more information about drug offenses and some of our recent case results, please visit our Drug Offense PracticeCenter and Recent Results page.\n\n## CONTACT OUR DRUG DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nOur Arizona drug defense attorneys have helped numerous clients beat drug charges related to methamphetamine. Often overzealous police and federal officials perform illegal searches and violate people’s Fourth Amendment rights. If you have been charged with a drug offense related to methamphetamine, please contact Blumberg & Associates. When your future is on the line, you need an Arizona drug defense law firm where skill and experience are more than just a slogan.\n"
