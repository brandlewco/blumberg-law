    text: "Money laundering is a criminal charge that usually accompanies other charges such as drug trafficking or fraud. If you have been charged with money laundering in Arizona, call the\_**Phoenix money laundering attorneys**\_at Blumberg & Associates for a free initial consultation to discuss your case.\n\nAny time you attempt to pay someone with money gained from illegal activities or attempt to deposit those funds in a bank account or in a corporate shell, you could be charged with money laundering. If you are convicted, you face the loss of the money and a prison sentence.\n\nThis charge is often used against drug dealers who want to legitimize money from drug sales. However, people who had nothing to do with the criminal activities can be charged with money laundering. For example, if you make a cash deposit on behalf of another person or accept a cash payment for services or products of $10,000 or more without reporting it to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), you can also be charged with money laundering.\n\nTo charge you with money laundering, prosecutors must prove that you knew or should have known that the money was obtained through criminal activities.\n\n## FREE ATTORNEY CONSULTATION\n\nIf you have been charged with money laundering, please contact a Phoenix money laundering attorney\_at Blumberg & Associates as soon as possible. Our defense lawyers frequently negotiate with the state and federal authorities throughout Arizona, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Postal Service. In many cases, we have successfully persuaded prosecutors not to charge our clients or to file reduced charges.\n"
