    text: "Even if you are offered probation for a sex offense in Arizona, you could still end up being forced to register as a sex offender for the rest of your life. At the law firm of Blumberg & Associates, our\_**Phoenix sex offender registration attorneys**\_offer a free initial consultation to explain how sex offender registration works and how it would apply to your case.\n\nIf you have been charged with a sex crime, you should never attempt to resolve your case without considering the ramifications of sex offender registration. Arizona requires all adult sex offenders to register with the Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS) and local law enforcement agencies following the resolution of their criminal cases. Many people who plead guilty to sex crimes and receive relatively mild punishments are blindsided by Arizona’s requirement for lifetime sex offender registration and treatment. Failure to register is a crime subject to imprisonment.\n\nThere are three levels of sex offender registration in Arizona, based on risk levels to people in the community. Information about people on the registry is easily searchable by name, location and type of offense on a Web site maintained by the Arizona DPS. If you are forced to register, you will be tagged as a sex offender for the rest of your life. Every time you move, you will have to notify local police who, in turn, will notify your neighbors about you and the sex crime you committed.\n\nThe lawyers at Blumberg & Associates will handle all post judgment issues related to your sex crime case, including sex offender registration. Our goal will be to resolve your case in such a way that you will not be forced to register as a sex offender.\n\n## FREE ATTORNEY CONSULTATION\n\nIf you are concerned about the implication of sex offender registration in Arizona, please contact a lawyer at Blumberg & Associates in Phoenix as soon as possible. The sooner you contact a defense attorney, the more your attorney can do to protect your rights and your future.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2250 Failure to Register\n"
