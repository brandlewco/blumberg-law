      At Blumberg & Associates, our **Phoenix children crimes attorneys** are
      committed to defending people throughout Arizona who are charged with
      dangerous crimes against children. Dangerous crimes against children are
      those sex offenses that are committed against children under the age of 15
      years old. Typical dangerous crimes against children include:


      *   **Sexual Conduct with a Minor** (some penetration or what is known as
      “manual masturbatory conduct”), and


      *   **Molestation of a Child** (the direct or indirect touching of a child
      under the age of 15 for sexual interest)


      *   **Sexual Exploitation of a Minor** (possession or distribution of
      child pornography)


      It should be noted that child molestation includes direct or indirect
      touching over a child’s clothing. Additionally, if a child is forced to
      touch the adult in a private part over the adult’s clothing, for sexual
      interest, the molestation has occurred.


      ## SENTENCING IN DANGEROUS CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN


      The most severe portion of the Arizona’s mandatory sentencing laws
      concerns Dangerous Crimes against Children.


      **Sentencing – Sexual Conduct with a Minor**


      Sexual Conduct with a Minor is the most severe crime with which a person
      can be charged in the State of Arizona, short of Murder in the First
      Degree. The sentence for one count of Sexual Conduct with a Minor under
      the age of 15 is a minimum of 13 years, a presumptive term of 20 years and
      an aggravated term of 27 years. All of the terms of imprisonment must be
      served day for day: there is no early release provision. You may also be
      added to a public Sex Offender Registry.


      The Arizona Revised Statutes pertaining to sentencing for Sexual Conduct
      with a Minor also provide that the term of imprisonment must be served
      consecutively to any other sentence for any other offense committed at any
      time. Consequently, if a person is on parole when sentenced, or is
      sentenced to other criminal acts during the same trial, none of the
      offenses may run concurrently, or at the same time as, the imprisonment
      for any other offense.


      There is no probation eligibility for the crimes of Sexual Conduct with a
      Minor or Sexual Molestation.


      **Sentencing – Molestation**


      One count of Molestation is punishable by a minimum of 10 years, a
      presumptive term of 17 years and a maximum of 24 years in prison. The term
      of imprisonment must be served day for day: there is no provision for
      early release.


      ## PROBATION IN DANGEROUS CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN CASES


      Under the right circumstances, a person charged with a Dangerous Crimes
      against Children offense can have the charge reduced to an “attempt” of
      one of these crimes, which may make them probation eligible. On occasion,
      the County Attorney’s Office will stipulate to probation, but more often,
      they will give a person a “no agreements” plea, in which case the
      individual’s attorney must advocate before the Court for probation for
      one’s client.


      ## EXPERTS IN ARIZONA DANGEROUS CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN CASES


      When you retain an Arizona sexual offense lawyer to represent you in a
      Dangerous Crimes Against Children case, the lawyer must be familiar with
      the use of experts. Expert testimony is very important in *defending
      dangerous crimes against children charges*, particularly with respect to a
      syndrome known as the Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (CSAAS).
      The State often utilizes an expert to testify about a variety of theories
      stemming from this syndrome, including so-called “characteristics” of sex
      offenders and the so-called “victim cycle”. At Blumberg & Associates,
      through our years of criminal defense experience, we have developed
      relationships with some of the best and most distinguished criminal
      defense experts in the country.
