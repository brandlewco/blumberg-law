      A large body of federal criminal law has grown up over the years. Unlike
      Arizona criminal laws that are enforced and prosecuted at the local level
      by agencies with limited resources, federal agencies are able to bring the
      vast weight of the federal government down on a single individual, making
      a federal arrest and prosecution very high-pressure and intimidating.
      Agencies like the DEA, FBI or ATF put their resources toward wiretaps,
      stings and undercover operations, so the US Attorney often has a very
      strong case before any federal crime arrests are ever made.


      In this environment, you need the advice and support of a highly skilled
      and experienced criminal defense lawyer who knows how to navigate the
      federal criminal system and fight to get a good outcome for you when you
      are facing federal charges. In Arizona, **Phoenix federal crimes
      attorney** Bruce Blumberg is a Board-Certified Specialist in Criminal Law
      with a great deal of successful trial experience in criminal matters.
      Count on Blumberg & Associates to provide assertive, effective advocacy in
      any federal criminal case, including:


      *   Drug Crimes


      *   Sex Crimes


      *   White-Collar Crimes, including Medicare fraud and securities fraud


      *   Weapons offenses


      *   Federal Corrupt Practices Act (corruption and bribery)


      ## COMPREHENSIVE ASSISTANCE IN FEDERAL CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS


      Federal agencies like the FBI and the US Attorney’s Office are staffed
      with some of the brightest and well-trained attorneys in the country.
      Getting advice and representation from a top-flight criminal defense
      attorney at every stage of a federal prosecution is essential to achieving
      a good outcome in your case.


      Arizona criminal law specialist Bruce Blumberg provides strategic and
      effective advocacy throughout the federal criminal process, including all
      of the following steps:


      1.  ***Pre-Arrest*** – Where applicable, we’ll work to avoid charges ever
      being filed by convincing the government that they don’t have a strong
      case. We may also work to influence what specific charges are filed or
      negotiate how an arrest is carried out. We’ll also be involved in any
      interviews or requests for information to make sure your rights are
      respected and your defense is not compromised.


      2.  ***Grand Jury*** – A grand jury indictment is required to start any
      federal felony prosecution unless the defendant waives it. The grand jury
      holds its meetings in secret and witnesses cannot bring their attorney
      with them into the jury room. If called to a grand jury, we can help
      determine whether you are being called as a witness or suspect, and we can
      advise you before you enter the jury room.


      3.  ***Arrest*** – Once an arrest is made, our experienced federal
      criminal defense lawyer will stand by you at your initial appearance,
      arraignment, preliminary examination or other pre-trial hearings and
      appearances. We’ll help you determine how to plead, negotiate the terms of
      your bail or pre-trial release, or represent you at a hearing on pretrial
      detention. We can also prepare you for a probation interview with U.S.
      Probation and Pretrial Services to improve your odds of pre-trial release.


      4.  ***Plea or Trial*** – We’ll advise you of your options and represent
      you in plea negotiations or begin the process of preparing for trial. At
      this stage, we’ll collect and study evidence and build your defense
      strategy, and we’ll also make appropriate pre-trial motions to suppress
      evidence, dismiss one or more charges, or change the trial venue.


      5.  **Sentencing** – Sentencing in the federal court system is a separate
      phase that follows a conviction. Federal judges typically follow the U.S.
      Sentencing Guidelines, which provide a range of punishments for each
      federal offense, although these guidelines are advisory only. The judge
      can impose a sentence anywhere within the guidelines, including imposing
      the maximum penalty available for the offense. Alternatively, the judge
      may decide not to impose any additional jail time beyond that which has
      already been served during the trial. We’ll work to present you in the
      best light and argue all mitigating factors for the best result in the
      sentencing phase.
