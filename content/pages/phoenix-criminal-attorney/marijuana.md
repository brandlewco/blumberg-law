      Blumberg & Associates is a distinguished Arizona criminal defense law firm
      representing clients charged with drug crimes related to marijuana. Our
      **Phoenix marijuana attorneys** routinely represent people charged with
      drug crimes from throughout Arizona including Maricopa County, Yavapai
      County, Coconino County, Pinal County, and the cities of Phoenix, Mesa,
      Peoria, Tempe, Prescott, Tucson, Flagstaff, and Scottsdale.


      ## ARIZONA MARIJUANA LAWYERS


      A majority of our clients arrested on charges related to marijuana and
      charged with possession. In Arizona, most first time offenders convicted
      of possession of marijuana for personal use are eligible for probation and
      the sentence is generally suspended. However, they are required to attend
      drug treatment. Other charges related to marijuana, such as possession
      with intent to sell, cultivation of marijuana, or importation into the
      state carry much more severe sentences.


      People charged with possession with intent to sell and have more than four
      pounds face a prison sentence of four to ten years and a fine up to
      $150,000. Our Arizona marijuana drug defense lawyers have significant
      experience handing cases related to marijuana sale and possession.


      For more information about drug offenses and some of our recent case
      results please visit our Drug Offense Practice Center and Recent Results
      page. Pick a phoenix marijuana lawyer with experience.
