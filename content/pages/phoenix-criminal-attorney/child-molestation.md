    text: "Child molestation is knowingly touching the genitalia (including over clothing) of someone under the age of 15. If you are under investigation for or have been charged with child molestation, our\_**Phoenix child molestation attorneys**\_offer a free initial consultation\_to evaluate your case.\n\nChild molestation is subject to severe penalties under Arizona’s mandatory sentencing laws. Anyone convicted of child molestation is required to serve a sentence of 10 to 24 years. The term of imprisonment is commonly known as “flat time,” which means there is no parole or early release. After you are released, you would be subject to the sex offender registration. Simply being charged with child molestation can lead to the loss of your parental rights under a civil action by Arizona Child Protective Services.\n\n## DEFENSES IN CHILD MOLESTATION CASES\n\nA Defense in a child molestation case can be that the alleged touching did not happen. You can also claim that the touching happened but was not for sexual interest.\n\nProsecutors in child molestation or sexual conduct with a minor cases will use experts who will testify as to the supposed common characteristics of sex offenders and of abused children. Invariably, there will be some characteristics that are in line with the facts of your case. A motion to preclude this kind of testimony should be brought by your sex crimes lawyer. Vigorous cross-examination by a skilled, experienced lawyer is needed to prevent prosecutors from painting a picture of you that falls in line with the profile of a child molester.\n\nIn all cases of child molestation or sexual conduct with a minor, your lawyer has to examine the background not only of the alleged victim but also the family. Sometimes accusers have motives (such as a child custody dispute) for making misrepresentations to the authorities. Often children make up allegations and then feel compelled to stick to their stories rather than be tagged as a false accuser. Our lawyers are experienced in the art of cross-examining children.\n\nThere is no probation for molestation. However, under certain circumstances, a person charged with child molestation can have the charge reduced to an attempted molestation of a child, which may make them eligible for probation.\n\n## FREE ATTORNEY CONSULTATION\n\nIf you are under investigation for or have been charged with child molestation in Arizona, please contact a sex crime defense lawyer at Blumberg & Associates in Phoenix as soon as possible. The sooner you contact a defense attorney, the more your attorney can do to protect your rights and your future.\n"
