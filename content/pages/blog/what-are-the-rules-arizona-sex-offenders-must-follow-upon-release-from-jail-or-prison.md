After a [sex offender](https://azblumberglaw.com/phoenix-criminal-attorney/sex-offender-registration/) is released from jail or prison, he or she may remain under supervision (probation) depending on the nature of the crime. If the offender is under supervision, he or she must register with the country sheriff’s office in the community he or she is relocating to within 72 hours of release. Sex offenders may be supervised in their day-to-day activities in order to protect their victims, vulnerable people and the general public. Sex offenders have other rules and regulations to follow.

**Here are some of the rules and regulations sex offender must abide by:**

- The offender must remain available for contact as directed by his or her probation officer.

- The offender must remain within specified geographic boundaries.

- The probation officer must approve the sex offender’s residence and living arrangements. Generally, the address is reviewed to assess potential risks to the community. Depending on the crime, the neighborhood may be notified of the offender’s presence.  Also, depending on the crime, offenders may not be permitted to live near schools, child care facilities or parks where children play.

- All parts of the offender’s residence will be inspected regularly.

- The offender cannot relocate without permission.

- The offender may or may not be allowed access to a personal computer depending on the nature of his or her crime. If a computer is allowed, it may have blocks installed to prevent access to specific types of sites or information.

- Offenders may not own or have in their possession any magazines, videos, telephones or anything else with pornographic content, nor can they patronize any establishment in the sex industry.

- Offenders are not allowed to be in possession of any drugs, alcohol or mood altering substances unless they have been prescribed by a doctor.

- Offenders may or may not be allowed contact of any kind with past or potential victims, including family members. That is an issue the court will decide.

- Offenders must submit to regular urine, breathalyzer or DNA testing.

- Offenders may not own, use or possess firearms or ammunition.

- Offenders must register with the county sheriff’s office if they are visiting or vacationing from another state for more than 10 days.

- Offenders are required to obtain a special driver’s license from the DMV each year.

**Offenders can expect help from the state of Arizona for the following\*:**

- Sexual deviancy counseling from state-certified counselors.

- Chemical dependency treatment and counseling through organizations like AA and others.

- Education, work and community service are encouraged, but with review and management of any potential risk.
