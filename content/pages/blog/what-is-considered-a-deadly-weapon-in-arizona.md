Here’s what you need to know about how Arizona law classifies deadly weapons to help you better understand the charges you are facing.

### **What are Deadly Weapons and Dangerous Instruments?**

Most people know handguns, assault rifles, knives, etc. can be declared a deadly weapon. However, those are not the only ones. The law defines a deadly weapon as anything that is designed to be lethal or could be capable of causing someone’s death. Other examples include machetes, explosives, brass knuckles, etc.

Arizona also has a definition of dangerous instruments, which can also be considered deadly weapons. A dangerous instrument could be anything that causes death to someone or serious injury in certain situations. What this means is that ordinary objects can be declared as dangerous instruments in some circumstances.

Dangerous instruments are not necessarily designed to be deadly, but they can be capable of causing someone’s death. Some examples can include a baseball bat, heavy rocks or bricks, a hockey stick, screwdriver, razor blade or box cutter, etc.

Many people do not realize that even a vehicle can be deemed a deadly weapon when you are involved in an accident while driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol that results in a physical injury or fatality.

### **What is Assault with a Deadly Weapon in Arizona?**

Assault with a deadly weapon is when you use a dangerous instrument or weapon to intentionally knowingly and often, recklessly cause injury to another person. It could also be when you knowingly place someone else in reasonable apprehension of impending physical injuries.

### **Defenses to Deadly Weapons Charges**

If you are charged with a crime involving deadly weapons, all hope is not lost. There may be one or more defenses available to you, which is why it’s imperative you contact a Phoenix criminal defense attorney right away.
