If you believe you are under investigation for a crime, it’s imperative to be proactive and contact a skilled [Phoenix criminal attorney](https://azblumberglaw.com/phoenix-criminal-attorney/) right away. Obviously, most people will assume that is what any criminal defense attorney will tell you. However, there are numerous reasons why retaining an attorney early on is a better strategy.

Depending on the circumstances of the alleged crime, hiring a defense attorney before you are charged means there is an opportunity for your attorney to keep them from filing charges in the first place. If no charges are ever filed, then there is no risk of having an arrest or criminal conviction on your record.

Having advance warning that charges might be filed against you can be extremely helpful if you use that time wisely. When you retain an attorney, they will go over everything that you need to do and discuss what could happen in the pre-investigative stage. One of the most important tips they will tell you is to be careful with what you say and do not talk to the cops.

## Be Careful What You Say

If you are under investigation, then the police or an investigator may reach out to you. They will want to ask questions and maybe even ask to search your property. You should be very cautious about saying anything and do not let anyone search your property without a warrant.

What you say and do in the investigation can have a significant impact. You may say something seemingly unimportant, and it winds up being the missing puzzle piece in the investigation against you. You should always remain calm and be polite. Ask that you have an attorney present before answering any questions.

Understandably, you want to tell your story because you don’t believe you did anything wrong. However, you must let your attorney speak on your behalf. In many cases, the police will try to act like your friend. They may even ask you questions they already know the answers to as a way of trying to get you to admit something inadvertently.

## Do Not Allow Any Voluntary Searches

The police might show up at your home unannounced and catch you off guard. In their bid to collect evidence against you, they might try to get you to allow them to search your premises voluntarily. They might see if you will invite them in and have a casual look around while talking with you. Do not allow any officer to conduct a search of your premises without a search warrant. They need to follow the rules of criminal law and procedure by getting a search warrant first.
