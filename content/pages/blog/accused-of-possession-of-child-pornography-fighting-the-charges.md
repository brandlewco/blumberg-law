## What is Child Pornography, and What is Possession of it ?

In order to understand any moving forward with accusations, it is important to identify and have an understanding over what child pornography is characterized as and classified as legally.

First and foremost, it is important to recognize that there are no legal protections for child pornography as expression of a First Amendment Right, but rather is considered contraband under federal law. Section 2256 of Title 18 in the United States Code defines child pornography as any visual depiction of any sexually explicit conduct involving a minor.

This depiction includes any photograph, image, or video taken, manufactured digitally, or modified to include the likeness in appearance of an identifiable minor. Any undeveloped film or electronically stored data that can be converted into an image or video are also deemed child pornography under federal law.

As such, federal law considers possession and transmission of child pornography as the production, distribution, importation, reception, or possession of any of the content previously mentioned.

The state of Arizona maintains concurrent jurisdiction of all child pornography cases alleged to have been committed in Arizona. Arizona entitles the crime, “sexual exploitation of a minor.” The penalties are severe: mandatory prison sentences of a minimum-10/presumptive-17/ and maximum-24 “flat” years in prison for each image. Each count MUST run consecutively. We understand that the sentence seems so severe. County attorneys will charge a person with 10-12 counts, ensuring that a loss at trial will result in a mandatory sentence of 100-120 years. Plea offers often begin at 17 years. Sometimes it seems as if one Arizona county tries to compete with the other counties to see who can be more stringent.
