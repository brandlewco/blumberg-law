Fraud is one of the most common types of white-collar crimes, but it is not the only one. There are a variety of criminal offenses that can be classified as white-collar crimes, including those that involve embezzlement, conspiracy, extortion, and computer crimes.

If you are being charged with a white-collar crime in Arizona, it’s imperative that you take the charges seriously. White-collar crimes are typically federal offenses, which means there is often a mandatory minimum prison sentence. If you are facing criminal charges for a white-collar crime in Arizona, you need a skilled [Phoenix white collar crime attorney](https://azblumberglaw.com/phoenix-criminal-attorney/white-collar-crimes/) on your side.

## **Defining White-Collar Crime**

In general, white-collar crime is one that is carried out through deceptive means. They are not typically violent crimes. Some of the most common white-collar crimes we handle for Arizona clients include:

- Bank fraud

- Health care fraud

- Accounting and tax fraud

- Credit Card fraud

- Mortgage fraud

- Bribery

- Forgery

- Medicare fraud

- Corporate fraud

- Money laundering

- Embezzlement

- Corporate fraud

- Mail and wire fraud

- Computer and internet fraud

- Bankruptcy fraud

- Extortion

White-collar crime cases can be complex. The statutes are lengthy, and that can lead to confusion on exactly what is defined as white-collar crime. This is why you need an experienced Phoenix white-collar crime attorney to defend you.

## **Importance of Retaining an Arizona White-Collar Crimes Attorney**

With white-collar crimes, you could be under investigation for weeks, or maybe even months, before you are arrested for a crime. If you suspect you are under investigation, don’t wait until you are arrested. It’s important to retain an attorney sooner rather than later.

If you retain an attorney before you are arrested, we can start working on keeping the authorities from filing charges. We can learn a lot about the investigation as it’s going on and also speak with law enforcement officers on your behalf.

You need to be careful and limit your conversations with law enforcement while you’re being investigated. Don’t believe that they are on your side. They may try to get you to believe that they are on your side, but they aren’t. Their goal is to get you to say something incriminating that will help their case. They may tell you that they are looking for a way to help you clear yourself, but that’s rarely ever the case.

## **Defenses to White Collar-Crimes**

There are a number of defenses that may work in white-collar crimes in Arizona. Some of the most common ones are:

- Lack of Intent — Many white-collar crimes must show that you had the intent to commit a crime. If the prosecution is unable to show that you intended to commit a crime, then the charges might be dropped.

- Victims are Also Guilty — Your case may involve a larger group that has also engaged in white-collar crimes. If this is the case, then the other party might not be eligible to collect restitution and the government might decide to drop the charges against you.

- Lack of Knowledge — If there are multiple parties involved, you may not have even been aware that there was any wrongdoing happening.
