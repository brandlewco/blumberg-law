Sometimes the best way to deal with divorce is to spot the warning signs before you’re faced with a decision to end your marriage. Below we’ll review five of the top trends or traits that are frequently found in divorcing couples. If you fit these categories is doesn’t mean your relationship is destined to fail, but you should be aware of the trends.

1.  **Cash Counts.** According to [a study posted by the American Sociological Review](https://www.asanet.org/wp-content/uploads/attach/journals/aug16asrfeature.pdf), the primary factor leading to divorce is the husband’s job status. When compared to men who have steady, gainful employment, men who do not have a job have a markedly higher risk of becoming divorced in any given year. Couples who fight about money have a significantly higher risk of facing divorce, but men without jobs are an additional 30 percent more likely to see their marriage end in divorce than even the couples who routinely fight about funds.

2.  **Finance Fight.** Similar to the trend above about job security, couples who fight about money – whether before marriage or in marriage – [stand a much higher chance of divorce than couples who have a more harmonious relationship with their money](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1741-3729.2012.00715.x). Sometimes what appears to be a fight about how money is spent is truly an argument about power, trust etc., but equally damaging to a relationship. If you and your partner can’t have the money talk without someone sleeping on the couch, this is a major topic you should proactively address before walking down the aisle.

3.  **Divorce DNA?** There are lots of myths in society that children whose parents are divorced are destined to walk in their parents’ footsteps and follow down the divorce path as well. Is that true? There is some data to back up the theory that children who lived through their parents’ divorce are at an increased likelihood to endure the same fate, and there are differing beliefs as to exactly why. The statistics are strong, however, that adults who lived through their parents’ divorce when they were young have a [harder time forming and maintaining healthy, intimate adult relationships](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-divorce-bad-for-children/).

4.  **Higher Power.** Studies indicate that couples who identify as religious, are at a decreased risk of divorce. Additionally, [couples who share the same faith and attend religious services together are even less likely to see their marriage end in divorce](https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/psychology/graduate-program/clinical/the-psychology-of-spirituality-and-family/research-findings/divorce.html). If you ask “why” these couples seem to have longer marriage success, the answer becomes somewhat murky. Some couples stay together because they feel it’s expected, and others feel it’s a “sin” to split, but nonetheless, the couples who pray together, stay together.

5.  **When age is more than just a number.** [Studies have indicated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7873718/) that the least likely age difference to lead to divorce is when the husband is between 2-10 years older than that wife. Inversely, when the wife is 2-10 years older than the husband the chance of divorce is disproportionately high. If you fit this category does it mean your relationship is destined for failure? Of course not, but it is an indicator that you should be aware of.

None of these signs of relationship risk is a death knell for your marriage, but couples should be aware of these frequent relationship stressors. If you fall into several of these categories, you can still beat the odds and live a long, happy marriage, but your awareness of pitfalls can help save the day, and keep you and your partner happy.
