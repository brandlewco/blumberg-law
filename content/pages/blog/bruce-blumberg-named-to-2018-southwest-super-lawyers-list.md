The *2018 Southwest Super Lawyers* list was released today and for the fifth time, Bruce Blumberg was recognized.

Blumberg was listed for his work as a criminal defense attorney in Arizona. Only 5 percent attorneys are selected to *Super Lawyers.*

Blumberg is certified as a specialist in criminal law by the State Bar of Arizona. Of the 18,000 licensed attorneys in Arizona, about 750 of them have received specialist certification, and only a handful of those are certified in the area of criminal law.

*Super Lawyers* is a rating service based on peer nominations that are supported by interviews, independent research, data verification and good-standing review. Only 5 percent of lawyers across Arizona and New Mexico are selected to the Super Lawyers list each year. Those selected are included in lists published both nationally in *Super Lawyers Magazine* and regionally in publications to serve as a resource for attorneys and consumers seeking outstanding legal counsel.
