When a minor is arrested for a criminal offense, they will go through a different judicial system experience than someone who is being charged as an adult. Because the court system is different, it’s important to retain a [Phoenix juvenile crime attorney](https://azblumberglaw.com/phoenix-criminal-attorney/juvenile-offenses/) who can help.

You want someone who understands how the system operates and can prepare the best defense possible. At Blumberg & Associates, we have years of experience helping Phoenix area families resolve criminal charges in juvenile court.

**How the Arizona Juvenile Justice System Differs**

There are a number of differences between a juvenile court proceeding and a case being tried in an adult court system. First, the matter will be decided by a juvenile court judge. There are no jury trials here. Second, the penalties in a juvenile court case are usually more focused on rehabilitation rather than punishment. The idea is to help juveniles become functioning members of society as they grow up in hopes they don’t wind up back in the court system as an adult.

In many scenarios, juvenile records are sealed. This means that the juvenile’s court records won’t follow them around for the rest of their lives like an adult conviction would. They would be free to apply for a job, pursue a professional license, or rent an apartment without the stigma of a criminal conviction.

**Being Tried as an Adult**

It’s important to point out that the court has the discretion to try the juvenile as an adult in some cases. When the charges involve a serious felony, there is the risk that the case might get transferred to the adult court system. If it does, it’s even more important that you have the best representation possible. Your child’s future can be greatly impacted by a criminal defense attorney who doesn’t have the skills and experience.

**Defending a Juvenile Client in Arizona**

While the court system differs when it’s a minor versus an adult being charged, the defendant’s rights don’t. Even a minor has the right to a quality defense.
