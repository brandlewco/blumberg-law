Solicitation has its own definitions as well. In Arizona, Sec 23-52, it has a specific guideline for determining how to classify solicitation of prostitution. The first and clear solicitation of prostitution manifests itself clearly through directly offering to, agreeing to, or committing an act of prostitution.
