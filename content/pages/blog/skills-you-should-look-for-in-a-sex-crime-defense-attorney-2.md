Anybody charged with a crime has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. When it comes to sex crimes, however, the court of public opinion is often eager to pronounce an accused person guilty before a court has had a chance to reach its verdict. Sex crimes are extremely serious, not just because they can result in extremely long prison sentences, but because just being charged with a sex crime is often enough to significantly harm one’s public reputation. If you are facing charges related to a sex crime, you risk far more than prison time. Your job, housing, and relations with friends and family could also be at stake, which is why you need to look for a [Phoenix sex crime lawyer](https://www.azblumberglaw.com/phoenix-criminal-attorney/sex-crimes/) who has the skills necessary to represent you.

**A Proven Track Record**

You don’t want your attorney “learning on the job” when he is defending you against such serious charges. Look for an attorney who has a proven record handling serious criminal defense cases, including sex crime cases. A criminal defense attorney who deals mostly with misdemeanors, for example, probably isn’t the best choice when you need somebody who understands the unique challenges posed by a sex crime case. An attorney should be able to provide you with examples of sex crime cases where he has successfully defended his clients.

**A Negotiator and a Litigator**

When it comes to sex crimes, you want an attorney who can be effective both in and out of the courtroom. Some attorneys strive to avoid litigation, for example, while others are seasoned litigators but lack the skills that are necessary when negotiating with the prosecutor. If you have been charged with a sex crime you will want your lawyer to negotiate on your behalf before the trial begins to hopefully get the charges reduced or dropped. If the case goes to trial, you also want somebody who is going to be aggressive in the courtroom and dedicated to challenging the prosecutor’s case.

**The Representation You Need**

Sex crimes are not something to be taken lightly. Your freedom, employment, reputation, and even your relationships could be at stake. Furthermore, if convicted in Arizona you generally face serious prison time and you could be required to register as a sex offender and undergo treatment. Don’t risk your future by hiring an attorney who lacks the experience and expertise necessary to handle your case. Talk to a [sex crime defense attorney](https://www.azblumberglaw.com/phoenix-criminal-attorney/sex-crimes/) today who knows what you are up against and how to best respond to any charges that have been laid against you.
