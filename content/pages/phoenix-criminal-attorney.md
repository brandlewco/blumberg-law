    text: "When you are arrested and charged with a criminal offense, the consequences you face can be severe. Depending on the charges, you could be looking at expensive fines, months in jail or years in prison. In addition to criminal penalties, you could lose your driver’s license or a professional license, and your ability to get or keep a good job. Persons convicted of crimes in Arizona soon find out how that conviction impacts every area of their life, from where they can live and work to their reputation in the neighborhood, community and even their relationships with friends and families. You owe it to yourself and your loved ones to take any criminal charge seriously and secure the best legal representation you can get. Bruce Blumberg is a Board-Certified Specialist in criminal law. Contact our experienced\_**Phoenix criminal attorney**\_today.\n\n## Pick One Of Arizona's Most Experienced Criminal Defense Attorneys\n\nYour best chance at a favorable outcome in your criminal case is being represented by an attorney who has extensive experience in representing people in circumstances similar to yours. There are a lot of criminal defense lawyers in practice, and not all of them will be suitable to your needs. In order to find the best attorney for you, here are few things to consider in your search:\n\n*   Find out as best you can what percentage of an attorney’s caseload mirrors your kind of case. Certain types of crimes may require a more specialized attorney. For example, you may want to find an attorney that deals primarily with [drug offenses](https://azblumberglaw.com/blog/what-happens-when-you-are-caught-with-dangerous-drugs-in-arizona/), [white collar crime](https://azblumberglaw.com/phoenix-criminal-attorney/white-collar-crimes/), or [juvenile justice](https://azblumberglaw.com/phoenix-criminal-attorney/juvenile-offenses/).\n\n*   Ask for personal references from the attorney. While these may not be completely objective, talking to another of the attorney’s clients may give you a better sense as to whether a lawyer is a good fit for you.\n\n*   Figure out the attorney’s rates. Some lawyers will ask for a flat fee up front, while others will work on an hourly basis. A lawyer with a great reputation in a certain area will likely charge more. Depending on the severity of the crime and what’s at stake, you may decide it is worth it to pay the extra money.!\n\n[](stackbit_asset_id:static:public/images/bruce-blumberg-portrait.png)\n\n### Your First Meeting\n\nWhen meeting with a lawyer for the first time, try and present him or her with as much information as possible. Here are some things to remember:\nBring any and all documentation you have pertaining to your arrest. This might include:\n\n*   Warrants or police documentation of items seized\n\n*   Charging documents\n\n*   Bail papers\n\n*   Dates and times of future appearances\n\n*   A police report, if you can get one\n\n*   Your driver’s license or ID\n\n*   Any records of prior arrests or convictions\n\nBeing involved in the criminal justice system can be very scary for the average person. Finding a Phoenix criminal defense attorney that you trust and then arming him or her with as much information about your case as possible is the best thing you can do to make your case go smoothly.\n\n## If You've Been Arrested In Phoenix, Contact Blumberg & Associates Right Away!\n\nBefore you phone your family or talk to the police, make your first call be to an experienced and successful Phoenix criminal attorney who can advise you of your rights and immediately take charge to help you get the best result after an arrest for any misdemeanor or felony offense.
